# Introduction
This project acts as courswork for the Principles of Data Science module of the MSc Data Science course at City, University of London. The key elements of the coursework were to:
1.  Conduct a tiny data science project from start to finish and write this up as a research paper with a supporting Notebook.
2.  Identify some well-motivated analytical questions for your data.
3.  Analyse steps taken for: data preparation, data derivation, construction of models, and validation of results.
4.  State your findings and reflect on the extent they answer your original research questions and how useful and actionable they may be for the application domain.
